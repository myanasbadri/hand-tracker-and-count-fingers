The hand tracker project utilizes Python's OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time video streams. By leveraging MediaPipe's Hand module, the program identifies hand landmarks and uses them to determine which fingers are raised. The key steps include initializing the video capture and the MediaPipe Hand module, processing each video frame to detect hand landmarks, and using the coordinates of these landmarks to count the number of raised fingers. The raised fingers are detected by comparing the position of specific landmarks (e.g., the tip of each finger) relative to others. The number of raised fingers is then displayed on the video frame. This project demonstrates efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
